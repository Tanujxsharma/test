app.use(express.json());
app.get('/todos', (req, res) => {
  res.json(todos);
});
app.post('/addTodo', (req, res) => {
  const newTodo = { id: todos.length + 1, title: req.body.title, completed: false };
  todos.push(newTodo);

The DOM  is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. It represents the structure of a document as a tree of nodes, where each node represents an element, attribute,
or piece of text.
role of the DOM in JavaScript -

interactive, and engaging web pages

question 3 - 
Sort method - 
If we call sorted on an array it will return a new array that sorted in ascending order. In order for this method to work the elements in the array need to conform to the
Comparable protocol.
Map method - 
 It iterates through the array that is calling it, but instead of sorting it changes each element of the array based on the closure passed to the method.
